# PLAN — Living Plan

This is the **living plan** for the repo. It is the single source of truth for what is
being worked on, kept current at all times and committed on the `develop` branch so any
machine can pull the latest state and continue. Always update this file together with the
code change it describes.

**Status markers:** `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked/failed

- **Last updated:** 2026-06-19
- **Branch:** develop
- **Now working on:** Release v5.9.0 (merge develop→master, tag, publish package)

---

## Active

- [~] Release **v5.9.0**: bump version + PackageReleaseNotes, merge develop→master, tag `v5.9.0`
  with release notes, build the NuGet package and publish to GitHub Packages (+ NuGet.org if a key
  is available).

## Todo

_(queued tasks — marked `[ ]`)_

## Done

- [x] Set up cross-machine task tracking (PLAN.md, TASKS.md, CLAUDE.md workflow section) — committed on develop (e7e73aa)
- [x] Expose public file-metadata resolver — added `RemoteFileResolver` + `RemoteFileInfo` so consumers can fetch a remote file's name/size (and range support) without starting a download; wraps `SocketClient.SetRequestFileNameAsync`/`GetFileSizeAsync`. Tests in `RemoteFileResolverTest`. (4ac4d39)
- [x] Use the metadata concept internally (no duplication) — added canonical `SocketClient.GetFileInfoAsync` (name+size+range in one probe); `DownloadService.StartDownload` now consumes it instead of separate `GetFileSizeAsync`/`IsSupportDownloadInRange` calls; `RemoteFileResolver` delegates to it; exposed `IDownloadService.GetFileInfoAsync(url)`. 165 regression tests + new tests pass. (9d740df)
- [x] Document `RemoteFileResolver` in README (new "get file name and size without downloading" section + Key Features bullet) and left a self-prompt in the **Downloader.Desktop** repo (its PLAN.md/TASKS.md) to migrate the downloads grid to it — note: blocked there until a package release >5.8.1 ships the API.
